Greenhouse live temperature measurement analytics

### Live version of client-side application you may find [here](https://celcius-tech.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

IoT React.js client application that subscribes to a topic on MQTT Broker and reads LIVE data from the topic channel. In a particular case, the application reads LIVE temperature measurements in a greenhouse and displays analytics in a dynamic chart.

This client application is only a part of the whole system of temperature measurement analytics. 
**The server side of the application you can find [here](https://github.com/romanplkh/java-iot-thermistor)**

Inspired by previous hack-a-thons, the application was created with the intent of learning more about IoT, network programming.

## Installation

```bash
    npm install

    npm start
```

## Usage

- Fork and clone application
- Install dependencies
- Since it is the client-side of a system, you need to clone and fork server-side from my other repo [java-iot-thermistor](https://github.com/romanplkh/java-iot-thermistor) with additional instructions

- To be able to read data from MQTT server you will need an instance of MQTT Broker running on your localhost. You may download a version of an open-source MQTT Broker from [here](http://emqtt.io/downloads/)
